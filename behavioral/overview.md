# overview of behavioral experiments

### experiment 1

difference between unresolved and resolved ambiguity (features 2 independent groups of participants)
repeats of complete sets of stimuli to test for temporal stability
preference revealed through comparison against controlled variaton of certain counteroffers

current setup:
* trial types = 2 (risk, ambiguity)
* EVs = 1 (fixed at 20)
* variance levels = 4
* linear counteroffers = 12
* repeats = 4 (in 2 sessions)

total trials = 384 (+ training)

### experiment 2

unresolved ambiguity with higher resolution of variance at different levels of EV (one sample)
preference revealed through comparison against controlled variaton of certain counteroffers

basic setup:
* trial types = 2 (risk, ambiguity)
* EVs = 2 (8.5 & 34)
* variance levels = 9
* linear counteroffers = 12
* repeats = 0 (1 session)

total trials = 432 (+ training)

### experiment 3

unresolved ambiguity directly compared to risky trials (includes ellsberg paradox) at different levels of EV (one sample)
comparing preference for risk or ambiguity at different levels of variance directly

basic setup:
* trial types = 1 (risk vs ambiguity)
* EVs = 6 (7.25 * [1 2 3 4 5 6])
* variance levels = 15
* linear counteroffers = N/A 
* repeats = 2 (in 2 sessions)

total trials = 180 (+ training)
